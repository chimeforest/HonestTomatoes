# HonestTomatoes
Upon hearing that Rotten Tomatoes does not include 0 or 1/2 stars in their user review average, I thought I'd make a little program to test that.

Sadly, the public user reviews stop at around 51 pages in, AND I don't have access to scores without a written review, so the data is incomplete.

Also, I've found no reliable sources which state that they ignore 0 and 1/2 stars, but this was a fun little project anyway.
